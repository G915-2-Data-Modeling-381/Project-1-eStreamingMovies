## Analysis of Team Models

To be updated during 9.30.2022 meeting

**Oliver** 
CDM:
- Good descriptions
- - Did not remove previous structure 
- Old model retained s.t (physical copy) customers can rent physical movies even with streaming service
- MovieStreamingService platform for customer services associated with it 
- CustomerService is incoporated into the model (?) if you come across payment issues, perhaps links to employees that are a part of this service?
- Digital Copy vs Physical Copy to retain some of the existing model
LDM:
- Movie modifications astreamableVersion
- Streaming service tables are very neat, idea for customer cards to have a maximum well done
- Views retained for invoices and over-due notice
-
